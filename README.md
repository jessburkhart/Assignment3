This program creates elements in the queue, and with functions, it prints the queue to the user and moves the first element to the back of the queue. Then, it shows the new queue with the first element at the rear. It, also, creates a vector and displays it to the user. It, then, finds the last occurrence of the target number 3. This program, then, creates a linked list with elements in a random order. It, then, uses insertion sort to sort the elements and displays it to the user.
